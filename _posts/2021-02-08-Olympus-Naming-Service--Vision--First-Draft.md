## Olympus Naming Service (ONS) - Vision - First Draft


### tl;dr:

- increase utility and circulation of OHM 
- allow Ohmies to register names like `zeus.ohm`
- easily convert a hooman-readable name to wallet address (and in reverse) 
- have one common identity and profile across the econOHMy 

### **Why**
OHM, the community-owned reserve currency, must be easy to send, receive and spend. The next wave of DeFi apps will rely on OHM as currency. The friction to use OHM as currency is a huge blocker towards increased adoption.

**Existing Problems**
- P2P transactions: a user must copy&paste long wallet addresses right now, no simple way to verify who you're sending money to
- Users that want to receive transactions don't want to send their long wallet addresses (0x3E9B...) or QR codes 
- User want to receive transactions for their work/effort/memes under one identity, but want to switch wallets 

**Benefits to Ohmies and the econOHMy**
- rely on Olympus-powered infrastructure to send, receive and spend OHM easier and safer
- share the meme of Olympus beyond (3, 3) by having a `name.ohm` address
- simplify on-chain governance process by seeing names instead of wallet addresses
- log into Olympus pro partners dapps with your `name.ohm`


### What
In the future(TM) ONS can extend into login/notification of all dApps of Olympus and Olympus Pro partners
## 
## What can go wrong
- rollout depends on wider econOHMy and Olympus Pro partners to accept `name.ohm` addresses
  - ONS must collaborate with partners from the beginning and offer easy to use APIs 
- general smart contract risk

### Next steps
- request for comments on this initial vision document
- refine based on comments and feedback 
- start Olympus Grant process
- ...
- (Ω, Ω)

### Questions
**Why not ENS**
I imagine the OHM currency to be independent of .eth infrastructure and generic -> OHM lives in ethereum and other chains, has no affinity 

**Why now?**
The foundation for a community-owned reserve currency was laid in 2021. Now we need to build out the utility and infrastructure. We should invest now into infrastructure that is powered by OlympusDAO.
